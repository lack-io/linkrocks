/// Handles spawning tasks which can also be cancelled by calling `cancel` on the task controller.
/// If a [`std::time::Duration`] is supplied using the
/// [`with_timeout`](fn@TaskController::with_timeout) constructor, then any tasks spawned by the
/// TaskController will automatically be cancelled after the supplied duration has elapsed.
///
/// This provides a different API from Context for the same end result. It's nicer to use when you
/// don't need child futures to gracefully shutdown. In cases that you do require graceful shutdown
/// of child futures, you will need to pass a Context down, and incorporate the context into normal
/// program flow for the child function so that they can react to it as needed and perform custom
/// asynchronous cleanup logic.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use tokio::time;
/// use tokio_context::task::TaskController;
///
/// async fn task_that_takes_too_long() {
///     time::sleep(time::Duration::from_secs(60)).await;
///     println!("done");
/// }
///
/// #[tokio::main]
/// async fn main() {
///     let mut controller = TaskController::new();
///
///     let mut join_handles = vec![];
///
///     for i in 0..10 {
///         let handle = controller.spawn(async { task_that_takes_too_long().await });
///         join_handles.push(handle);
///     }
///
///     // Will cancel all spawned contexts.
///     controller.cancel();
///
///     // Now all join handles should gracefully close.
///     for join in join_handles {
